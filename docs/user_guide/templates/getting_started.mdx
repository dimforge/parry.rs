**Parry** relies on the official Rust package manager
[Cargo](https://crates.io) for dependency resolution and compilation. Therefore,
making **Parry** ready to be used by your project is simply a matter of
adding a new dependency to your `Cargo.toml` file. You can either use the **parry2d**
crate for 2D geometry or the **parry3d** crate for 3D geometry. You can even use both
if you need both 2D and 3D in your application. Note that you will probably
need **nalgebra** as well because it defines algebraic entities
(vectors, points, transformation matrices) used by most types of **Parry**.
Note that **nalgebra** is re-exported by **Parry** under the alias **na** (e.g
`parry3d::na::Vector3`).

```toml
[dependencies]
# Choose the one you need, or both.
# Replace the * by the latest version.
parry2d = "*"
parry3d = "*"
```

Until **Parry** reaches 1.0, it is strongly recommended to always use its
latest version, though you might encounter breaking changes from time to time.

## Cargo example
Here is a complete example of `Cargo.toml` file:

<Tabs
  groupId="dim"
  defaultValue="2D"
  values={[
    {label: 'Example 2D', value: '2D'},
    {label: 'Example 3D', value: '3D'},
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="2D">

```toml
[package]
name    = "example-using-Parry"
version = "0.0.0"
authors = [ "You" ]

[dependencies]
// TODO: replace the * by the latest version number.
parry2d = "*"

[[bin]]
name = "example"
path = "./example.rs"
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="3D">

```toml
[package]
name    = "example-using-Parry"
version = "0.0.0"
authors = [ "You" ]

[dependencies]
// TODO: replace the * by the latest version number.
parry3d = "*"

[[bin]]
name = "example"
path = "./example.rs"
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
