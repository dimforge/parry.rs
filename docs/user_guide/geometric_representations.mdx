Different representations of geometric objects will lead to different
algorithms. Currently, **Parry** relies a lot on convex shapes described by
a [support mapping](#support-mappings). However, working exclusively with
convex shapes is too restrictive so **Parry** provides [composite
shapes](#composite-shapes) that allows the construction of a concave shape from
its convex parts.

{/* TODO: #composite-shapes link is broken until we figure it out. */}

Geometric primitives supported by **Parry** are defined on the `shape`
module. They all share a common [dynamic
representation](#dynamic-shape-representation).  Note that all geometric
primitives have a predefined constant local frame equal to the identity matrix.
Thus, one usually has to store a transformation matrix separately from
the shape itself in order to reach any location and orientation.

### Support mappings

**Parry** supports generic algorithms that work for any (possibly
user-defined) shape defined by a support map. The support map (argument) of a
shape $\mathcal{A}$ is a function that returns the point $\mathbf{p}$ that
maximises its dot product with a given direction $\mathbf{v}$. Such a point
point $s_{\mathcal{A}}(\mathbf{v})$ is called a _support point_:

$$
s_{\mathcal{A}}(\mathbf{v}) = \arg \max\limits_{\mathbf{p} \in \mathcal{A}} \left< \mathbf{p}, \mathbf{v} \right>
$$

 This can be seen as a function that returns a point of the support mapped
 shape which is _the furthest on the given direction_. Such a function is
 enough to describe completely a convex object. If several points are eligible
 to be support points for a given direction $\mathbf{v}$, any one of them can
 be returned (preferably a corner). The following shows support points for the
 shapes $\mathcal{A}, \mathcal{B}$ and $\mathcal{C}$, given two directions
 $\mathbf u$ and $\mathbf v$:

The support mapping function is exposed by the `SupportMap` trait.

| Method                            | Description |
|--                                 | --          |
| `.support_point(m, v)`            | Computes the support point (in the direction `v`) of the caller transformed by the transformation matrix `m`. |
| `.support_point_toward(m, v)`            | Same as `.support_point(...)` except that `v` is already a unit vector. |

Most basic geometric primitives like balls, cubes, cones, can be described by their support
mappings. This allows a useful level of genericity for several geometric
queries on **Parry**.

### Ball
The `Ball` designs a disk in 2D, or a sphere in 3D, both centered at the origin.


| Field | Description |
| --          | --       |
| `.radius` | The radius of the ball. |

```rust
let ball = Ball::new(1.0f32);
assert!(ball.radius == 1.0);
```

### Cuboid
The `Cuboid` structure describes a rectangle in two dimensions or a cuboid in
three dimensions. A cuboid is defined by its _half extents_, i.e., its
half length along each coordinate axis.

| Field | Description |

### Cone
The `Cone` structure describes a cone of revolution in three dimensions.
A cone is defined by the _radius_ of its basis and its _half height_ − the
half distance between the basis and the apex. It points upward, its principal
axis is the $\mathbf{y}$ axis, and its apex has coordinates `(0, cone.half_height(), 0)`.

### Capsule
The `Capsule` structure describes either a rectangle with extremitis replaced by half-discs (in 2D),
or a cylinder with extremities replaced by half-balls (in 3D). A capsule is defined by the _endpoints_
of its rectangular/cylindrical part and the _radius_ of its extremities. It is centered at the origin and
its principal axis is the $\mathbf{y}$ axis.

| Method | Description |

### Convex hull

A convex hull represents the smallest convex envelope of a set of points.

The `ConvexPolygon` (in 2D) and `ConvexPolyhedron` (in 3D) structures can be used to represent a convex hull.

Remember that an object is said to be convex if it is not self-crossing,
and if it contains all segments joining two of its points:

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>

![convex, concave, crossed](/img/convex_concave_crossing.svg)

</div>

The `ConvexPolygon` (in 2D) and `ConvexPolyhedron` shape (in 3D) are created from a set of points using the `::from_convex_hull(points)` constructor.
Note that this explicitly computes the convex hull of the input point cloud.
If you already computed the convex hull on your side, you may use `::from_convex_polyline(...)` (in 2D) or `::from_convex_mesh(...)` (in 3D) instead (described later in this section).


| Method | Description  |
| --        | --           |
| `.points()`  | The points used to create the `ConvexPolygon` or `ConvexPolyhedron` shape. |

    Point2::new(0.5, -0.5),

assert!(convex.points().len() == 6); // The convex hull has only 6 vertices.
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>


If you have the ability to provide the convex hull directly, you may use `::try_new(...)` instead. It won't compute explicitly the convex hull of the points but expect the input to describe one. In 2D, the given vertices are expected to be ordered such that they appear counterclockwise on the convex polygon boundary. In 3D, the provided index buffer must be such that each triangle is properly connected to its neighbors and is oriented counterclockwise, i.e., given a triangle `ABC`, the cross product $(B - A) × (C - A)$ should result in a vector pointing toward the exterior of the convex polyhedron.

];

let convex = ConvexHull::from_convex_mesh(points, &indices).expect("Invalid convex shape.");
assert!(convex.points().len() == 6);
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>


Keep in mind that while those constructors will fail if the topology of the convex hull is invalid,
or if it contains degenerate faces, it does not check the convexity of the input.
Therefore, `::try_new(...)` may succeed even if your input is not actually convex.
In that case, you may experience odd results for various geometric queries.
You can call `check_geometry`
(in 3D) to verify its convexity.

# Composite shapes

**Parry** supports shapes that are defined as aggregations of others. Every
composite shape must implement the `CompositeShape` trait which defines methods
for accessing their individual parts using indices. The composite shape is assumed to
be immutable, i.e., an index must always map to a shape and local
transformation that both remain constant over time. The indices must be contiguous
and on the range $[0, shape.nparts()[$

| Method | Description |
| --          | --        |
| `.nparts()` | The number of parts on this compound shape. |
| `.map_part_at(i, f)` | Applies the closure `f` to the `i`-th part and its local transformation matrix. |
| `.map_transformed_part_at(i, m, f)` | Applies the closure `f` to the `i`-th part and its local transformation matrix with `m` appended to it. |
| `.aabb_at(i)` | The `AABB` of the `i`-th part of the composite shape. |
| `.bvt()` | The space-partitioning acceleration structure used by the composite shape. |

The requirement to use a `BVT` for space-partitioning is extremely restrictive
and will be replaced by a more flexible system in the future. Currently, three
composite shapes are available on **Parry**. The `Compound` describes the
union of any shape supported by **Parry**. The `TriMesh` and the `Polyline`
are dedicated to assemblies of triangles and segments.

*/}

### Compound
The `Compound` structure is the main way of describing concave shapes from
convex ones. It is a set of any [shape handle](#dynamic-shape-representation).

| Method | Description |
| --          | --        |
| `.shapes()` | The shapes composing the compound. |
| `.aabbs()` | The `AABB` of the shapes composing the compound. |
| `.qbvh()` | The space-partitioning acceleration structure used by the compound. |

Two steps are necessary to create a `Compound`:

1. Initialize a vector of shape handles with their positions and orientations
  relative to the origin.
2. Call `Compound::new` with this vector.

### Polyline
The `Polyline` structure describes a set of contiguous segments.
It is constructed from arrays of vertices, each vertex being linked
to its adjacent elements on this array.

The `TriMesh` structure is only available in 3D and describes a mesh
of triangles. It is constructed from arrays of vertices and indices
describing its triangles. It is also possible to provide one texture coordinate per vertex;
those are not used for contact determination but are useful for, e.g., ray-tracing applications.

# Other shapes
Some shapes do not fall into any of the general categories described above.

## Dynamic shape representation

In order to select the right algorithms for geometric queries on specific
shapes, `Parry` has to be able to distinguish at runtime different shapes
from their types and they capabilities. As described by [another
chapter](geometric_queries) of this guide, there are two kinds of geometric
queries: those that operate on a [single
shape](geometric_queries/#single-shape-queries) and those that operate on
[two shapes](geometric_queries/#pairwise-queries) simultaneously.  In the
first case, runtime algorithm selection is performed with the help of traits
which can be easily implemented for user-defined shapes and exposed at runtime
by a `Shape` trait-object. On the other hand, queries involving two shapes
require more complex dispatch mechanisms that are not yet customizable by the
user.

{/* Is it still not customizable? */}

### The shared shape trait-object
Elements to inspect shape representation and capabilities are provided for each
shape by implementing the `Shape` trait. The `ShapeHandle` structure is nothing
more than a `Shape` trait-object wrapped into an `Arc`.

`Shape` implements `RayCast` and `PointQuery`, see [Geometric queries chapter](geometric_queries) to learn more.

| Method                    | Description |
|--                         | --          |
| `.compute_aabb(m: &Isometry<N>)`            | The AABB of the shape transformed by `m`.            |
| `.compute_bounding_sphere(m: &Isometry<N>)` | The bounding sphere of the shape transformed by `m`. |
| `.as_convex_polyhedron()` | Converts `self` to a `ConvexPolyhedron` trait-object. |
| `.as_support_map()`       | Converts `self` to a `SupportMap` trait-object.      |
| `.as_composite_shape()`   | Converts `self` to a `CompositeShape` trait-object.   |

All the conversion methods have a default implementation returning `None`.
This allows you to only partially implement the trait if some of those features
are of no interest to you or even not applicable for your specific shape. For
example it is extremely rare to implement both `.as_composite_shape()` and
`.as_support_map()` as algorithms applicable to the latter will almost always
be more efficient than for the former.

Methods related to bounding volumes have default implementations as well
except for AABB construction. AABBs are widely used throughout **Parry** so
their tightness is critical for good performances. Other bounding volumes are
less used so by default they are deduced from the AABB itself. Those default
implementations will unfortunately only result in very loose bounding volumes
so it is advised to provide your own to ensure optimal performances.
