Meshes can be computed from other meshes as well. This may be useful to make
them usable by some geometric queries that have specific requirements. For
example most queries on **Parry** require the objects to be convex or to be
the union of several convex objects. A convex hull or a convex decomposition
may thus help to pre-process complex concave meshes.

## Convex Hull

Besides the `ToTriMesh` and `ToLinestrip` traits, the `procedural` and
`transformation` modules export free functions that generate various meshes and
line strips, including those accessible by the two former traits.

It also exposes functions to compute the convex hull of a set of point using
the [QuickHull algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QuickHull) which has an
average $O(n \log{n})$ time complexity:

| Function            | Description                                     |
| --                  | --                                              |
| `convex_hull(...)` | Computes the convex hull of a set of points. |

If you are not interested in the `Polyline` representation of the 2D convex
hull but only on the original indices of the vertices it contains, use the
`_idx` variant of the function âˆ’ namely `convex_hull2d_idx(...)`.
The following example creates 100,000 random points and compute their
convex hull.

```

## Approximate convex decomposition

While [convex](geometric_representations#convex) objects
have nice properties that help designing efficient algorithms, studies show
that using only convex objects leads to very boring applications! That is why
**Parry** allows the description of concave objects from its convex parts
using the `Compound` shape. For example, one could describe the following
object as the union of two convex parts:

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>

![Convex decomposition](/img/concave_decomposed.svg)

</div>

But decomposing manually a concave polyhedra into its convex parts is a very
tedious task and computing an exact convex decomposition is often not
necessary. That is why **Parry** implements the 3D { /* TODO: it seems to be V-HACD now. (I guess `V` for voxel) */}
[HACD](https://kmamou.blogspot.fr/2011/10/hacd-hierarchical-approximate-convex.html)
algorithm that computes an **approximate** convex decomposition. It is not yet
implemented in 2D.


### <abbr title="Hierarchical Approximate Convex Decomposition">HACD</abbr>

The HACD is simply a clustering algorithm based on a concavity criterion to
separate the different groups. It will group triangles together until the
directional distances between their vertices and their convex hull do not
exceed an user-defined limit.

To compute the decomposition of a triangle mesh, use the `transformation::VHACD::decompose`
function. It takes four arguments:

| Argument         | Description |
| --               | --          |
| `params`           | The parameters for the VHACD algorithm execution. |
| `points`          | The vertex buffer of the polyline (in 2D) or triangle mesh (in 3D). |
| `indices` | The index buffer of the polyline (in 2D) or triangle mesh (in 3D). |
| `keep_voxel_to_primitives_map` |  If set to true then a map between the voxels computed during the decomposition, and the primitives (triangle or segment) they intersect will be computed. This is required in order to compute the convex-hulls using the original polyline/trimesh primitives afterwards (otherwise the convex hulls resulting from the convex decomposition will use the voxels vertices). |

Let us define what _normalized concavity_ means. Because there is no official
definition of the concavity of a 3D object, we are using the maximal distance
between the triangle mesh vertices and its convex hull. This distance is
computed along the direction of the vertex normal (hence, it is usually
different from the intuitive distance obtained by orthogonal projection of the
point on the closest convex hull face):

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>

![Concavity measure](/img/concavity.svg)

</div>

Then, to make this concavity measure kind of independent from the whole shape
dimensions, it is divided by the object AABB diagonal $D$:

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>

![Concavity normalizer](/img/concavity_normalizer.svg)

</div>

We call the ratio $\frac{d}{D}$ the _normalized concavity_. In this example,
it is equal to $\frac{6.0}{10.0} = 0.6$.


The `transformation::VHACD::decompose` function returns a `VHACD`, which you can use to obtain your convex decomposition:
- call `.compute_convex_hulls()` to approximate a decomposition of the input mesh { /* TODO: use a table ? + explain the downsampling parameter*/}
- call `.compute_exact_convex_hulls()` to compute an exact decomposition of the input mesh.


The following figure shows a tube (left), the result of the clustering done by
the {/* TODO: v-hacd there ? a bit confusing, would be better to mention "exact" */} HACD algorithm (middle), and the resulting approximate convex decomposition
(right):

The following example creates a concave object using a
[path-based](#paths) mesh generation and approximates it
using the HACD algorithm. Together with
[kiss3d](https://github.com/sebcrozet/kiss3d), this code was used to generate
the figure above. { /* TODO: what to do about kiss3d ? */}

let (decomp, partitioning) = transformation::hacd(trimesh.clone(), 0.03, 0);
