Performing some tests on an approximation of the shape of an object is often
useful to accelerate several geometric queries. For example testing two convex
polyhedrons for intersection is extremely time-consuming. Instead, we could
test that their spherical approximations (namely, their [bounding
spheres](#bounding-sphere)) intersect. Then if the approximations fail this
test there is no need to perform the same query on the original polyhedra. This
test-on-the-approximations-first approach is known as _pruning_.


The approximations presented here are conservative with regard to the object
volume, i.e., the approximated shape is completely contained inside of the
approximating object. Those are called _bounding volumes_. Many bounding
volumes exist on the literature, depending on their specific uses. For example,
the following figure shows a 2D polygon bounded by a bounding sphere, an Axis
Aligned Bounding Box (AABB), an Oriented Bounding Box (OBB), and a convex hull.
Not all of them are implemented on **Parry** yet:

</div>

Note that bounding volumes are very different from regular shapes: their
positions and orientations are completely encoded in the bounding volume
structure so they do not require a separate transformation matrix to reach any
position in space. All bounding volume must implement the `BoundingVolume`
trait:


| Method            | Description |
|--                 | --          |
| `.intersects(bv)` | Checks `self` for intersection with `bv`.              |
| `.contains(bv)`   | Returns `true` if `bv` is completely inside of `self`. |
| `.merge(bv)`      | Merge `self` and `bv` in-place. |
| `.merged(bv)`     | Returns a bounding volume, result of the merge of `self` with `bv`. |
| `.loosen(m)`      | Dilates `self` by a ball of radius `m` in-place.          |
| `.loosened(m)`    | Returns a copy of `self` dilated by a ball of radius `m`. |
| `.tighten(m)`     | Erodes `self` by a ball of radius `m` in-place.          |
| `.tightened(m)`   | Returns a copy of `self` eroded by a ball of radius `m`. |

{ /* is "by a ball" a technical term ? */}

The `.loosen(...)` and `.loosened(...)` (resp. `.tighten(...)` and
`.tightened(...)`) methods allow you to dilate (resp. erode) the bounding
volume by a given margin. This will effectively make the new bounding volume
strictly larger (resp. thinner) than the original one if `m` is not zero.  This
is useful, e.g., to optimize some [broad
phase](collision_detection_pipeline/#broad-phase) algorithms.

`Shape` requires the following bounding methods to exist:

| Method               | Description |
| --                   | --          |
| `.compute_local_aabb()` | Computes the local bounding volume of `self`. |
| `.compute_local_bounding_sphere()` | Computes the local bounding sphere of `self`. |

`Shape` also implements a default implementation inferred by their local variants:

| Method               | Description |
| --                   | --          |
| `.compute_aabb(m)` | Computes the bounding volume of `self` transformed by `m`. |
| `.compute_bounding_sphere(m)` | Computes the bounding sphere of `self` transformed by `m`. |


## Bounding Sphere

The `BoundingSphere` is a sphere that contains completely the bounded shape.
While this is the less tight bounding volume, it has the benefit of being
invariant with regard to isometric transformations. Thus, translating and
rotating the bounded shape will not modify the radius of its bounding sphere.
Bounding spheres support [ray casting](geometric_queries/#ray-casting) and
[point queries](geometric_queries/#point-projection).

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>

![bounding sphere](/img/bounding_volume_bounding_sphere.svg)

</div>

It is fully defined by its center and its radius:

| Field     | Description                                                    |
|--         | --                                                             |
| `.center` | The bounding sphere center. |
| `.radius` | The bounding sphere radius. |


Of course, the bounding sphere implements the `BoundingVolume` trait. The
following shows the effect of the `.loosen(m)` and `.tighten(m)` methods on it:

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>

![Bounding sphere loosening](/img/bounding_volume_bounding_sphere_loose.svg)
![Bounding sphere tightening](/img/bounding_volume_bounding_sphere_tight.svg)

</div>

There are two ways to create a bounding sphere:
- Use
the usual static method `BoundingSphere::new(center, radius)`
- With the `s.compute_bounding_sphere(m)` function,
where `s` and `m` are the `Shape` and its position (e.g. a transformation matrix).

The following example computes the bounding spheres of two cuboids,
merges them together, creates an enlarged version of the second one,
and performs some tests.

## Axis-Aligned Bounding Box

As suggested by its name, the `AABB` is a box with principal axis aligned with
the positive coordinate axises $\mathbf{x}$, $\mathbf{y}$, $\mathbf{z}$.

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>

![AABB](/img/bounding_volume_aabb.svg)

</div>

Its orientation being fixed at all times, it is completely defined by the
position of its extremal vertices (the two vertices with extremal values along
each coordinate axis):

| Field   | Description                                                    |
|---------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| `.mins` | The AABB vertex with the smallest coordinates along each axis. |
| `.maxs` | The AABB vertex with the greatest coordinates along each axis. |


Of course, the AABB implements the `BoundingVolume` trait. The following shows
the effect of the `.loosen(m)` and `.tighten(m)` method on it:

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>

![AABB loosening](/img/bounding_volume_aabb_loose.svg)
![AABB tightening](/img/bounding_volume_aabb_tight.svg)

</div>

An AABB supports [ray casting](geometric_queries/#ray-casting) and [point queries](geometric_queries/#point-projection) as well.

There are three ways to create an AABB:

- The main one is to use the usual
  static method `AABB::new(mins, maxs)`. This will fail if one component of
  `mins` is strictly greater than the corresponding component of `maxs`.
- The second one is to use the unsafe constructor `AABB::new_invalid()`. It is unsafe
  because the result AABB is invalid: its `mins` field is set to 
  [Bounded::max_value()](https://docs.rs/num-traits/0.2.19/num_traits/bounds/trait.Bounded.html#tymethod.max_value) and
  its `maxs` field is set to { /* TODO: why isnÂ´t it min_value ? */}
  [-Bounded::max_value()](https://docs.rs/num-traits/0.2.19/num_traits/bounds/trait.Bounded.html#tymethod.max_value).
This is useful to initiate the merging of multiple AABB.
- The third construction
  method is to use the `s.compute_aabb(m)` function, where `s` and `m`
  are the shape and its position (e.g. a transformation matrix).

The following example computes the AABB of two balls,
merges them together, creates an enlarged version of the second one, and
performs some tests.

let ball2_pos = Isometry2::identity(); // Identity matrix.

/*

let aabb_ball1 = ball1.compute_aabb(&ball1_pos);
let aabb_ball2 = ball2.compute_aabb(&ball2_pos);
